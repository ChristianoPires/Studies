# Studies
A simple App as example incremented following my studies

# The App

In the first view/screen, the data retrieved from the API is presented in a TableView;

Data Displayed:
  - Program name;
  - Genre;
  - Synopsis;
  - Average of evaluations;
  - Assessments;
  - Poster of the program.

Functionalities:
  - List the popular television programs (default function of the app);
  - Like a program;
  - List favorite programs (the list is static, this means that every time you close and open the app, the list is reset).

The feature of favoriting a program works as follows:
  - Double click on the program you want to bookmark and it has been added to the list. (As of 12/23/2020, no visual or sensitive feedback has been implemented for the user, when such feedback is implemented, the readme will be updated.)
  
List favorite programs:
  - Just click on the "favorites" button on the toolBar, after the click it redirects you to another screen with your favorite programs listed. If you want to go back to the first screen, just click on the "back" button in the navigationBar, and then you will be returned to the home screen where you can continue to see popular programs and favor more programs.
